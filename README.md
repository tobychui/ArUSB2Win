ArOZ USB Drive Filename to Windows Filename Converter - 
This is a simple tool for users to convert all the UM-filename files use in ArOZ File System into normal Windows readable file naming method.

To use it, simply download the exe file, select the USB drive mount point (e.g. F:\ or G:\ ) or any sub-directory and press "Decode". 
This will decode all the filename and folder recursively into readable filenames on Windows.

If you want to mount the USB drive back into the ArOZ Online System, simply select your USB drive mount point again and press "Encode".
